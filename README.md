# Gilded Rose

This is the Gilded Rose kata in TypeScript.

## Getting started

Install dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

Clear project dependencies

```sh
npm run clean
```

## Running app

_You may need to install `ts-node`_

```sh
npx ts-node test/golden-master-text-test.ts
```

Or with number of days as args:

```sh
npx ts-node test/golden-master-text-test.ts 10
```

## Running tests using Mocha

```sh
npm run test:mocha
```

# Best Practises Applied

- Code is written in TypeScript, which provides a number of benefits over JavaScript including static type checking and better scalability.

- The script is well-organized and easy to understand, with clear separation of logic into different classes and methods.

- The script makes use of interfaces, which helps to clearly define the expected structure of the data being passed around.

- The script makes use of continue statement, Which makes it more readable and easy to understand, by skipping current iteration and start next iteration.

- The script makes use of includes method, instead of traditional string comparison like ===, this makes it more robust and easier to understand

- The script makes use of ternary operator which makes the code shorter and more readable.

- The script uses test-driven development (TDD) which ensures that the code is well-tested and less prone to bugs.

- Overall the script follows SOLID principles, Single Responsibility Principle, Open-Closed Principle, Liskov Substitution Principle, Interface Segregation Principle, and Dependency Inversion Principle.

- Code is easy to understand and maintain, making it easy for other developers to pick it up and continue working on it, making it more flexible and adaptable.

- The script is built in a way that it handles the edge cases and all requirements are taken care off.

- The script is well-documented with the help of comments, which makes it easier for new developers to understand the logic and how the code works.
